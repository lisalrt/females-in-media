                        <h3 style="text-align: left; vertical-align: center;">Which media are considered respected or popular?</h3> 
                        <p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 10px;">Different media sources are likely to have different tendencies in the content they create, the news they cover and consequently the quotes they use. Readers also perceive the quality of news and articles in function of the media source. In order to explore whether prejudices on media sources are truly reflected in real life, this section compares the representation of females in respected and popular media. The respected media are known to share news stories backed by facts and deemed reliable, while the popular media instead contain the media pages that are most often visited, but not necessarily "respected". A subset of quotes is analysed and quotes originating only from a shortlist of media sources are kept, as presented in the table. These media sources were selected according to the following sources: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2017/02/01/10-journalism-brands-where-you-will-find-real-facts-rather-than-alternative-facts/?sh=1c18e04de9b5" target="_blank">respected</a>,  and <a href=" https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/news-and-media/" target="_blank">popular.</a>

                        <h3 style="text-align: left; vertical-align: left;">And how do they evolve over the years?</h3> 
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">At a first glance, how do these two groups of media differ in female representation through quotes? While one would hope that respected media would perform better in terms of equal gender representation, this figure shows that it is not the case. In fact, a gap is present between popular and respected media every single year. <br><br> The increase in proportion of females over the years in either group is encouraging, with the drop in 2020 likely present due to the reduced number of quotes collected for that year. The increasing trend surely reflects the awareness on gender issues that has increasingly been voiced and mediatised.<br>

Other respected media such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">BBC</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Politico</span> behave similarly, starting at a low proportion of females in 2015 and gradually increasing throughout the years. Within the popular media, sources such as <span style="font-style: italic;">CNN</span> have higher proportions early on (18.5% in 2015) and continue to increase. It is also the popular media that present the quickest increase: <span style="font-style: italic;">msn</span> goes from 14.6% in 2015 to 25.2% in 2018. It is interesting to note that the proportion differs more within respected and popular media rather than between them. </span></p>

                        <h3 style="text-align: center; vertical-align: center;">But what do females talk about?</h3> 
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">When thinking of the possible differences between "respected" and "popular" media, the differences in categories covered come to mind. Indeed, the type of news presented by the sources differ thematically, politically and in terms of audience. The overall proportion of females does not give insight into <span style="font-style:italic;">what</span> they are quoted for and how this differs between the respected and popular media. 
                        <br><br>
                        By analysing keywords present in the URL of the article or page containing the quote, the quotes themselves are sorted into different categories of news. Seven main categories were predefined and indicator words allowed to classify the quotes into these various categories. Only approximately 50% of the quotes were attributed to a category, and the quotes not belonging to any on the predefined topics were ignored for this analysis. Analysing categories of quotes allows to see if there are trends between genders based on topics, and help explain the results observed for the proportion of females depending on the media source.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather unsurprisingly, the proportion of female quotes is dependent on the category of news, regardless of the type of media. The repartition of categories among the genders appears to follow stereotypes: very few females are quoted in sports, while entertainment and culture present higher shares of female quotes. Media sources such as <span style="font-style: italic;">msn</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Yahoo</span> are expected to post more about entertainment and celebrity news than <span style="font-style: italic;">Politico</span> for example. These are categories where females typically appear more, thus explaining the higher proportion of female quotes achieved by the popular media. Particularly in 2018, when more than 50% of the quotes in the entertainment category originated from females. This maximum is the only occurence of a majority of female quotes.</p>

If certain sites produce several articles on the same story and use the same quote, this will increase the overall proportion of female quotes.

                            The number of distinct speakers is used to determine the diversity of speakers represented within each gender. The graph to the right depicts the number of males who have been quoted for a single female. This conclusion is obtained by dividing the number of male speakers by the number of female speakers in both respectable and popular media. It is interesting to note that for every female, at least two males are quoted; this ratio rises for topics like politics, science, business, and sports. The ratio varies more between categories than between popular and respected media, indicating that the topic is more influential on how females will be quoted. <br><br>
                            This deduction also brings a new perspective to the results obtained previously with regard to the proportion of females in popular entertainment. Whereas females appeared to be quoted more in entertainment by popular media, there are still twice as many distinct males for every female. Hence, the same women are repeatedly quoted and makes the overall proportion of female quotes increase. In fact, there are not truly over 50% of females in this category. This reduced number of distinct females could indicate that there are more barriers for females in media, making it harder for them to be quoted compared to males.</span>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Less distinct females are present in the dataset, but when they are, are they given the same "space"? It can be interesting not only to look at how the proportion of quotes by females varies in categories and media type, but also analyse changes in the <span style="font-style: italic;">time allocation</span> they are given. A simple metric for this is the quote length. Taking the categories that tended to quote more equally females and males, i.e. entertainment and culture, the quote length can be compared. Are there any differences in the quote length regarding these categories? And what about the quote length depending on the type of media?

                        Females have a propensity to hold longer quotes in the popular media than males, although the pattern is the opposite in the respected media covering culture. Despite the fact that the focus was placed on these two categories, the trend of females holding shorter quotes than males holds true across all years and categories.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Entertainment and culture were the two categories where the greatest proportion of females was observed. Do sources within respected and popular media have any differences in these precise categories? Apparently, yes. Even within respected or popular media, the proportions can vary notably. The overall highest proportion within popular media observed before can be detected here again. For culture, the proportion of females in respected media even has a tendency to decrease with time, such as for <span style="font-style: italic;color: #F96902;">Reuters</span> or <span style="font-style: italic; color: #aa0206;">Politico</span>.<p> 
                            </p>                            
                        </div>
                        <div style="width:900px;  margin-right: -80px;">
                            {% include percentage_quotes_entertainment_interactive_media.html %}
                        </div>

                                Within entertainment, there is more variation from one year to another, making a specific trend less evident. For the sake of illustration, BBC present in both respected and popular media jumps from 15.8% to 35.7% in one year before decaying again to 13.9% in 2018. On average, the respected media do seem to have lower proportions of female than the popular media. For example, <span style="font-style: italic;">msn</span> has above 50% of female quotes certain years, while the threshold of 40% is only exceeded in one case for the respected media: 46.3% for <span style="font-style: italic">New York Times</span> in 2019. 
                                <br><br>

                            One media source in particular stands out: <span style="font-style: italic;">Reuters</span>. While other media sources increase and decrease, it is the only source that has a net decline in female proportion for both entertainment and culture. However, looking at the proportion of female quotes in </span style="font-style: italic;">Reuters</span> globally and not within a category, the numbers only increase with time (see plot <a href="#Global_Reuters">here</a>). Could this mean that more females in <span style="font-style: italic;">Reuters</span> are being quoted in topics other than entertainment and culture?
                            </p>                            
                        </div>                           
                        
                    </div>
                    

                    <div style="height: 1350px;">
                        <h3>Why does the porportion of female in <span style="font-style: italic;color: #F96902;">Reuters</span> decrease in entertainment and culture?</h3>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                             If the proportion is decreasing in entertainment and culture, but the whole average is increasing, then females must be quoted more in other domains for <span style="font-style: italic;">Reuters</span> particularly. The previous analysis was performed by providing a list of topics and sorting the quotes accordingly. This could lead to a bias, as not all possible categories are considered. Furthermore, the category was inferred from the URL of the source of the quote, supposing that main keywords or the type of news is included in the URL itself. Again, this might not always be representative of the quote itself. <br><br>

                            By using natural language processing, quotes are tokenized, lemmatized, entities are detected, stopwords are removed and bigrams are included. A Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (LDA) is applied to a subset of this data. <span style="font-style: italic;">Reuter</span>'s quotes are analysed for the year 2015 and 2017, for both genders, and words from the quotes are clustered into 5 topics through unsupervised learning.<br><br>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Clusters of topics are grouped into main themes, as shown in the table above. This allows to observe the change in the themes most mentioned by males and females in 2015 and 2017. In 2015, females were not very present in topics like geopolitics. Many terms fall in a more vague theme, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">"feel”, “think”</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">“woman”.</span> Two years later, less of these terms are present for females, giving space to new and more pertinent terms such as <span style="font-style: italic;">“law, “North Korea”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">“deal”.</span> This could help explain the trend of decreasing proportion in entertainment and culture in the considered media. For males instead, the distribution changes less, with most of their quotes falling within politics, economics and geopolitics. In fact, in 2015 terms such as <span style="font-style:italic;">“attack”, “force”</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">“Iran”</span> appear for males as important terms. In 2017, similar terms alluding to the same themes can still be found, between them <span style="font-style: italic;">“policy”, “security”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">“China”</span>.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Throughout this project the reader was guided in the unequal distribution of gender representations in the media. This is not only a sad reality but also one with heavy consequences for aspiring future generations. Despite encouraging improvements over the years, gender equality in the media is by far not yet reached.
