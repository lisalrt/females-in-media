                        <h3 style="text-align: left; vertical-align: center;">Which media are considered respected or popular?</h3> 
                        <p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 10px;">Different media sources are likely to have different tendencies in the content they create, the news they cover and consequently the quotes they use. Readers also perceive the quality of news and articles in function of the media source. In order to explore whether prejudices on media sources are truly reflected in real life, this section compares the representation of females in respected media and popular media. Respected media includes media that is known to share news stories backed by facts and deemed more reliable. Popular media instead contains the media pages that are most often visited, but not necessarily "respected". A subset of quotes is analysed and quotes originating only from a shortlist of media sources are kept, as pressented in the table. Using the reduced dataset, quotes were selected if they belonged to a shortlist of media sources that was also in the dataset. These media sources were selected according to the following sources: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2017/02/01/10-journalism-brands-where-you-will-find-real-facts-rather-than-alternative-facts/?sh=1c18e04de9b5" target="_blank">respected</a>,  and <a href=" https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/category/news-and-media/" target="_blank">popular.</a>

                        <h3 style="text-align: center; vertical-align: center;">And how do they evolve over the years?</h3> 
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">At a first glance, how do these two groups of media differ in female represenation through quotes? While one could expect that respected media would perform better in terms of equal gender representation, this figure shows that it is not the case at all. In fact, a gap is present between popular and respected media every single year. <br><br> The increase in proportion of females over the years in either group is encouraging, with the drop in 2020 likely present due to the reduced number of quotes collected for that year. The increasing trend surely reflects the awareness on gender issues that has increasingly been voiced and mediatised<br>

                                <p style="color:white; padding: 5px; font-weight: bold;">- but no media source is even half-way close to gender equality.</p>

                        <h3 style="text-align: left; vertical-align: center;">How does the trend break down within a group of media?</h3> 
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">Within the respected or the popular media, not all the sources present the same proportion of female quotes, with proportions ranging between around 12% and 25%. <span style="font-style: italic;">Reuters</span>, a source considered to be respected, presents to lowest proportion of female quotes. Other respected media such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">BBC</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Politico</span> behave similarly between them, starting at a low proportion of females in 2015 and gradually increasing throughout the years. Within the popular media, sources such as <span style="font-style: italic;">CNN</span> have higher proportions early on (18.5% in 2015) and continue to increase. It is also the popular media that present the quickest increase: <span style="font-style: italic;">msn</span> goes from 14.6% in 2015 to 25.2% in 2018. </p>

                        <h3 style="text-align: center; vertical-align: center;">But what do females talk about?</h3> 
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">When thinking of the possible differences between "respected" and "popular" media, the differences in topics or categories covered come to mind. Indeed, the type of news presented by the sources differ thematically, politically and in terms of audience. The overall proportion of females does not give insight into <span style="font-style:italic;">what</span> they are quoted for and how this differs between the respected and popular media. 
                        <br><br>
                        By analysing keywords present in the URL of the article or page containing the quote, the quotes themselves are sorted into different categories of news. Seven main categories were predefined and indicator words allowed to classify the quotes into these various categories. This allows to see if there are trends between genders based on topics, and help explain the results observed for the proportion of feamles depending on the mdeia source.</p>

                    <div style="height: 600px;">
                        <div style="width: 40%; background-color: #cf755e; float:right; margin:0 auto; vertical-align: center;">
                            <p style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">In 2018, over 50% of quotes in entertainment were by females, for popular media.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div style="width: 50%; float: left;">
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather unsurprisingly, the proportion of female quotes is dependent on the category of news, regardless of the type of media. The repartition of categories among the genders appears to follow stereotypes: very few females are quoted in sports, while entertainment and culture present higher shares of female quotes. Media sources such as <span style="font-style: italic;">msn</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Yahoo</span> are expected to post more about entertainment and celebrity news than <span style="font-style: italic;">Politico</span> for example. These are categories where females typically appear more, thus explaining the higher proportion of female quotes achieved by the popular media. In 2018, more than 50% of quotes were from females in the entertainment category by popular media. This maximum is the only occurence of a majority of female quotes.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Some speakers' quotes are repeated by several media sources, for example as for Meghan Markle. If certain sites produce several articles on the same story and use the same quote, this will increase the overall proportion of female quotes. The numbers analysed until therefore do not reflect how many distinct females are quoted compared to men. Will the numbers change if consider the proportion of <span style="font-style: italic;">distinct</span> females to <span style="font-style: italic;">distinct</span> males?</p>
