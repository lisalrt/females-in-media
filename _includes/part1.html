                        With gender equality being raised in a wide variety of domains, a data-backed analysis can help our society understand its current position and the steps it needs to take to improve. This project aims at analysing the status of females through the lens of media. <br><br>
                        By using the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf" target="_blank">Quotebank</a> dataset, a corpus of english quotations from a decade of news, the project provides insights on how gender is represented. The data in this project covers quotes published between 2015 and 2020. The site names at the origin of the quotes were extracted from the URLs of the article, which was provided in the Quotebank dataset. Based on <a href="https://www.4imn.com/top200/" target="_blank">this list</a>, which uses Google Page Rank and other independent web metrics for various search engines (more about the ranking method <a href="https://www.4imn.com/about/index.htm#ranking" target="_blank">here</a>), 116 sites were selected based on their web ranking scores. Only quotes whose source was within this list were kept for the study. This filtering allowed to reduce the media sources to the most known and common journals or sites. <span style="color: red">Could be cool to add how many quotes we used or some more detailed stats per year</span>

                        <p style="text-align:justify;">
                            The average percentage of female quotes for each media's country of origin from 2015 to 2020 provides a preliminary glimpse into the countries involved and female representation in their media. At a first glance, media from France, Israel and Latvia have a low female representation compared to Germany, United Arab Emirates or Brazil. However, this note is to be taken with caution, as non-english speaking countries have only few newspapers about precise topics. This induces a bias in the gender representation for those countries. To illustrate this effect, France's only 2 media sources were Eurosport and Euronews, which could explain the low percentage as sports is clearly more mediatized for males. <br><br>English-speaking countries, on the other hand, have a greater number of newspapers and hence cover a wider range of topics.
                            Interestingly, the United Kingdom has the largest number of female quotes, with 23.74 percent, when compared to all other countries.
                            South Africa appears to quote more females than the United States in terms of total number of quotes. As a result, a more in-depth investigation will be conducted, focusing on these three countries in particular, in order to determine the causes of these patterns.

                        <p style="text-align:justify; margin-right: 5px">
                               The percentage of female quotes gradually increases for the UK, peaking at 26.81 span>&#37;</span> in 2019, while it remains relatively steady in the other two countries. Surprisingly, an abrupt decrease appears in 2020. This could be in part due to the the reduced number of quotes in 2020 in the dataset.<span style="I would remove these next phrases bcos we had less quotes for2020. This should be metnioned in the intro, I would also remove the pandemic stuff, that's strange"> Could that be due to the Corona pandemic, during which more health care professionals were quoted than usual? Could this confirm the gender disparity in high-level jobs and positions in the medical field? (numbers?) This questions goes beyond the scope of this country-based analysis and could be a research question on its own. </span><br><br>
                               The changes over time confirm the first perceptions about the countries: the United Kingdom, which had the greatest proportion of female quotes overall, has also had the largest increase over time.
                                South Africa and the United States, on the other hand, change less year to year, with South Africa having slightly higher proportions than the United States most of the time. Only in 2016 did the USA quote more females than South Africa. In 2016, the presidential election took place, as well as the famous rivalry between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton which was omnipresent in the media. Indeed, it may be interesting to focus on the distinct speakers and their individual impact on gender representation in media. An average for each year does not account for the diversity of quoted females, and one unique female may be very often quoted, skewing the prior analysis. <br><br>
                               The evolution of female quotes for the UK is encouraging but what if it is always the same female that is quoted? On the contrary, while is USA and South Africa the percentage stays constant, there could be changes in the number of distinct speakers.

                        <p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 25px;">
                                The speakers are now ranked according to the number of different quotes they said, without considering repetitions. The interactive network shows the top 3 speakers for each country and gender, in terms of number of occurrences in the dataset. The size of a node is proportional to the number of quotes from this speaker in the country in which he or she was cited, and the colors represent gender.  <br><br>
                                Here again, the unequal gender representation is manifested, since within each country, all the <span style="color: #529dc8;">male nodes</span> are bigger than the <span style="color: #cc78bc;">female nodes</span>. Donald Trump, as former president of the United States, was present on an international scene and many different topics. He is consequently the most quoted male in all countries. The other main speakers in the USA are all politicians, with an exception for Pope Francis. Females in the USA mostly quoted are for example Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi, who are females above 70 years old. In the UK, however, the most quoted female speakers tend to be celebrity or entertainment figures, such as Meghan Markle and Katie Price, who are younger females. On the other hand, all the males in the UK work in politics. In South Africa, the most prominent speakers are once again all political figures. The 3 most quoted females in South Africa fall in the age range of 50-70 years old. With these results in mind, it appears that the categories of news in different countries determine the proportion of females, as well as their age.

                    The age seems to affect the speakers that were most quoted.
                    The age distribution for both genders is displayed above, depending on the country.
                    The distinction between countries is obvious, and the distinction between genders is even more so.
                    After seeing the top speakers and typical male features, the age distribution of the males is not surprising.
                    Females, on the other hand, appear to have a different age distribution depending on the country.
                    In South Africa, 37.8 <span>&#37;</span> of the ladies mentioned are between the ages of 60 and 70, which is comparable with the top three female unique speakers from the prior network.
                    In the United Kingdom, the distribution is significantly biased towards younger females. 
                    This could also be explained by the network above, with two young females appearing in the top 3 for UK, on contrary to the other two countries. The top 3 however cannot justify these observation in the age distribution on its own. Indeed, since the proportion of distinct female speakers (see percentages above) <span style="color:red;">add this or remove the phrase</span> is much lower for the USA than for South Africa, one could expect Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi to have a big influence on the age distribution of females. This is however not the case here. A possible explanation for this contradiction is the fact that, despite having quoted some females only proportinally to their number of quotes, these females are very well distributed over the age intervals as one can see from the table below.  <span style="color: red">Are we including a table or proportions of distinct females @Arthur?
