                <p>With gender equality being raised in a wide variety of domains, a data-backed analysis can help our society understand its current position and the steps it needs to take to improve. This project aims at analysing the status of females through the lens of media. By using the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf" target="_blank">Quotebank</a> dataset, a corpus of quotations from a decade of news, the project provides insights on how gender is represented.</p><br>
                <p style="color:#FF0000">The data in this project covers quotes published between 2015 and 2020, and from a limited number of sources in order to facilitate the analysis. JUSTIFY HOW WE SELECTED THE SITES AND PUT A LINK SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THIS LIST.</p>
