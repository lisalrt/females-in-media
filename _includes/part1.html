                        With gender equality being raised in a wide variety of domains, a data-backed analysis can help our society understand its current position and the steps it needs to take to improve. This project aims at analysing the status of females through the lens of media. <br><br>
                        By using the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf" target="_blank">Quotebank</a> dataset, a corpus of english quotations from a decade of news, the project provides insights on how gender is represented. The data in this project covers quotes published between 2015 and 2020. The site names at the origin of the quotes were extracted from the URLs of the article, which was provided in the Quotebank dataset. Based on <a href="https://www.4imn.com/top200/" target="_blank">this list</a>, which uses Google Page Rank and other independent web metrics for various search engines (more about the ranking method <a href="https://www.4imn.com/about/index.htm#ranking" target="_blank">here</a>), 116 sites were selected based on their web ranking scores. Only quotes whose source was within this list were kept for the study. This filtering allowed to reduce the media sources to the most known and common journals or sites. <span style="color: red">Could be cool to add how many quotes we used or some more detailed stats per year</span><

                        <p style="text-align:justify;">
                            The average percentage of female quotes from 2015 to 2020 for each media's country of origin gives a first insight on the involved countries and the female representation in their media. At a first glance, media from France, Israel and Latvia have a low female representation compared to Germany, United Arab Emirates or Brazil. However, this is to take into consideration with care: as non-english speaking countries have only few newspapers about precise topics. This induces a bias in the gender representation for those countries. To illustrate this effect, France's only 2 media sources were Eurosport and Euronews, which could explain the low percentage as sports is dominated by males. <br><br> On the other hand, English speaking countries have a higher number of newspapers and hence cover a broader spectrum of topics. Interestingly, the United Kingdom has the highest percentage of female quotes compared to all the other coutries, with 23.74% <span>&#37;</span>. South Africa seems to quote more females, in proportion to its total number of quotes, than the United States. A deeper analysis will therefore be performed especially on these 3 countries, trying to identify the reasons behind these trends.

                        <h3 style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: center; margin-right: 5px;">What is the evolution of the percentage of female quoted accross the years?</h3>
                        <p style="text-align:justify; margin-right: 5px">
                               The percentage of female quotes gradually increases for the UK, reaching a maximum in 2019 with 26.81 <span>&#37;</span>, whereas it can remains rather constant for the other two countries. Surprisingly, an abrupt decrease appears in 2020. Could that be due to the Corona pandemic, during which more health care professionals were quoted than usual? Could this confirm the gender disparity in high-level jobs and positions in the medical field? (numbers?) This questions goes beyond the scope of this country-based analysis and could be a research question on its own. <br><br>
                               Again, the trends of South Africa and USA support our first impressions (<span style="color: red;">which were what?</span>). Only in 2016 did the USA quote more females than South Africa. In 2016, the presidential election took place, as well as the famous rivality between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, which was omnipresent in the media. Indeed, it may be very interesting to focus on the unique speakers and their impact on the gender representation in the media. An average for each year does not account for the diversity of quoted females, and one unique female may be very often quoted, biasing thus the previous analysis.<br><br>
                               The evolution of female quotes for the UK is encouraging but what if it is always the same female that is quoted? On the contrary, the number of distinct speakers might increase in the USA and South Africa which could be seen as counterbalancing the fact that their percentage stays constant.

                        <p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;">
                                The interactive network shows the top 3 speakers for each country and gender, in terms of number of occurrences in the dataset. The size of a node is related to the proportion of quotes from this particular speaker in the country that quoted him/her and the colors stand for gender. <br><br>
                                Here again, the unequal gender representation is manifested, since for all countries, all the <span style="color: #529dc8;">male nodes</span> are bigger than the <span style="color: #cc78bc;">female nodes</span>. Only the UK seems to have a "fair" repartition of nodes and a more diverse spectrum of speakers. Donald Trump with its many designations (?) is on its own the Top-3 of males in the american press with about 1/4 of the american quotes from 2015 to 2020. Indeed he was the President of the USA from 2016 to 2020 and was omnipresent in all categories. Interestingly, the 3 most quoted females in South Africa are all involved in politics and in the age range of 50-70 years old. On the other hand, Katie Price and Meghan Markle are media personalities and much younger. This stresses out how the age of the speakers can be crucial and determinant for his/her presence in the media, and this depending on the country.

                    USA quote 1 male (Trump) before the first female (Clinton)
                    UK quotes 4 males (Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Jose Mourinho, Donald Trump)  before the first female (Theresa May)
                    SA quotes 4 males (Donald Trump, Mmusi Maimane, Julius Malema, Emmerson Mnangagwa) before the first female (Patricia de Lille)
                -->

                    <h3>Does age determine who will be quoted?</h3>

                        Above, the age distribution is shown for the 2 genders, depending on the country The difference between countries is clear and the one between genders even more. Having seen the top speakers and the typical profiles of males, the distribution of the males' ages is not very surpising. For females however, the distribution of the age appears to vary in function of the country in question. 37.8 <span>&#37;</span> of the quoted females in South Africa belong to the age interval of 60-70 years old, which is consistent with the top 3 female unique speakers from the previous network. Regarding the UK, one can clearly see that the distribution is skewed towards younger females. This could also be explained by the network above, with two young females appearing in the top 3 for UK, on contrary to the other two countries. The top 3 however cannot justify these observation in the age distribution on its own. Indeed, since the proportion of distinct female speakers (see percentages above) is much lower for the USA than for South Africa, one could expect Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi to have a big influence on the age distribution of females. This is however not the case here. A possible explanation for this contradiction is the fact that, despite having quoted some females only proportinally to their number of quotes, these females are very well distributed over the age intervals as one can see from the table below.  <span style="color: red">Are we including a tabel??</span>
