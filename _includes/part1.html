                <p>With gender equality being raised in a wide variety of domains, a data-backed analysis can help our society understand its current position and the steps it needs to take to improve. This project aims at analysing the status of females through the lens of media. By using the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf" target="_blank">Quotebank</a> dataset, a corpus of english quotations from a decade of news, the project provides insights on how gender is represented.</p><br>
                <p style="color:#FF0000">The data in this project covers quotes published between 2015 and 2020, and from a limited number of sources in order to facilitate the analysis. JUSTIFY HOW WE SELECTED THE SITES AND PUT A LINK SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THIS LIST.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify;font-size: 14px;">
                            The average percentage of female quotes from 2015 to 2020 for each media's country of origin gives a first insight on the involved countries and the female representation in their media. At first glance, media from France, Israel and Latvia have a low female representation as compared to Germany, United Arab Emirates or Brazil. This is however to take carefully into consideration, as non-english speaking countries have only few newspapers about precise topics, thus inducing a strong bias in their gender representation. For the sake of illustration, France's only 2 newspapers were: 'Eurosport and XXXXX', which could explain the low percentage as women are less strong than men in sport! On the other hand, english speaking countries have a higher number of newspapers and hence a broader spectrum of topics. Interstingly, the United Kingdom has the highest percentage of female quotes over all the coutries, with only 23.74 <span>&#37;</span>, while South Africa seems to quote more female, proportionaly to its total number of quotes, than the United States. A deeper analysis will therefore be performed especially on these 3 countries, trying to identify the reasons of these differences (better word?).

                        <h3>What is the evolution of the percentage of female quoted accross the years?</h3>
                        The percentage of females quotes gradually increases for the UK, reaching a top in 2019 with 26.81 <span>&#37;</span>, whereas it can be considered as constant for the other two countries. Surprinsingly, an abrupt decrease appears in 2020. Could that be due to the Corona pandemic, during which mostly health care professionals were quoted? Confirming thus the gender disparity in top jobs of the medical field? (numbers?) This questions goes beyond the scope of this couontry-based analysis and could be a research question on its own. Again, the trends of South Africa and USA support our first impressions. Only in 2016 did the USA quote more female than South Africa. In 2016 took place the presidential election and the famous rivality between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton was omnipresent in the media. Indeed, it may be very interesting to focus on the unique speakers and their impact on the gender representation in the media. An average for each year does not account for the diversity of quoted females, and one unique female may be very often quoted, balancing thus the previous analysis.

                    The evolution of female quotes for the UK is encouraging but what if it is always the same female that is quoted... 
                    On the contrary, the number of unique speakers might increase in the USA and South Africa which could be seen as counterbalancing the fact that their percentage stays constant.

                            The interactive network on the left shows the top 3 speakers for each country and gender. The size of a node is related to the proportion of quotes from this particular speaker in the country that quoted him/her and the colors stand for gender.  Here again, the inequal gender representation is manifest, since independant on the country, all <span style="color: #529dc8;">male nodes</span> are bigger than <span style="color: #cc78bc;">female nodes</span>. Only Uk seems to have a "fair" repartition of nodes and a more diverse spectrum of speakers. Donald Trump, with its many designations (?) is on its own the Top-3 of males in the american press with about 1/4 of the american quotes from 2015 to 2020. Indeed he was the President of the USA from 2016 to 2020 and was omnipresent in all categories. Interestingly, the 3 most quoted females in South Africa are all involved in politics and in the age range of 50-70 years old. On the other hand, Katie Price and Meghan Markle are media personalities and much younger. This stresses out how the age of the speakers can be crucial and determinant for his/her presence in the media, and this depending on the country.
