                <p>With gender equality being raised in a wide variety of domains, a data-backed analysis can help our society understand its current position and the steps it needs to take to improve. This project aims at analysing the status of females through the lens of media. By using the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf" target="_blank">Quotebank</a> dataset, a corpus of english quotations from a decade of news, the project provides insights on how gender is represented.</p><br>
                <p style="color:#FF0000">The data in this project covers quotes published between 2015 and 2020, and from a limited number of sources in order to facilitate the analysis. JUSTIFY HOW WE SELECTED THE SITES AND PUT A LINK SO THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE THIS LIST.</p>

                            The average percentage of female quotes from 2015 to 2020 for each media's country of origin gives a first insight on the involved countries and the female representation in their media. At first glance, media from France, Israel and Latvia have a low female representation as compared to Germany, United Arab Emirates or Brazil. This is however to take carefully into consideration, as non-english speaking countries have only few newspapers about precise topics, thus inducing a strong bias in their gender representation. For the sake of illustration, France's only 2 newspapers were: 'Eurosport and XXXXX', which could explain the low percentage as women are less strong than men in sport! On the other hand, english speaking countries have a higher number of newspapers and hence a broader spectrum of topics. Interstingly, the United Kingdom has the highest percentage of female quotes over all the coutries, with only 23.74 <span>&#37;</span>, while South Africa seems to quote more female, proportionaly to its total number of quotes, than the United States. A deeper analysis will therefore be performed especially on these 3 countries, trying to identify the reasons of these differences (better word?).

                        <h3>What is the evolution of the percentage of female quoted accross the years?</h3>
                        The percentage of females quotes gradually increases for the UK, reaching a top in 2019 with 26.81 <span>&#37;</span>, whereas it can be considered as constant for the other two countries. Surprinsingly, an abrupt decrease appears in 2020. (Could that be due to the Corona pandemic, during which mostly health care professionals were quoted? Confirming thus the gender disparity in top jobs of the medical field? (numbers?) This questions goes beyond the scope of this couontry-based analysis and could be a research question on its own.)

                <p>
                    The evolution of female quotes for the UK is encouraging but what if it is always the same female that is quoted... 
                    On the contrary, the number of unique speakers might increase in the USA and South Africa which could be seen as counterbalancing the fact that their percentage stays constant.
