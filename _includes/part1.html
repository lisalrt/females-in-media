                        With gender equality being raised in a wide variety of domains, a data-backed analysis can help our society understand its current position and the steps it needs to take to improve. This project aims at analysing the status of females through the lens of media. <br><br>
                        By using the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf" target="_blank">Quotebank</a> dataset, a corpus of english quotations from a decade of news, the project provides insights on how gender is represented. The data in this project covers quotes published between 2015 and 2020. The site names at the origin of the quotes were extracted from the URLs of the article, which was provided in the Quotebank dataset. Based on <a href="https://www.4imn.com/top200/" target="_blank">this list</a>, which uses Google Page Rank and other independent web metrics for various search engines (more about the ranking method <a href="https://www.4imn.com/about/index.htm#ranking" target="_blank">here</a>), 116 sites were selected based on their web ranking scores. Only quotes whose source was within this list were kept for the study. This filtering allowed to reduce the media sources to the most known and common journals or sites. <br><br>
                        With this data, and in-depth analysis is done to understand:

                        <p style="text-align:justify;">
                            The average percentage of female quotes from 2015 to 2020 for each media's country of origin gives a first insight on the involved countries and the female representation in their media. At a first glance, media from France, Israel and Latvia have a low female representation compared to Germany, United Arab Emirates or Brazil. However, this is to take carefully into consideration, as non-english speaking countries have only few newspapers about precise topics, thus inducing a strong bias in their gender representation.<br> For the sake of illustration, France's only 2 media sourcess were: 'Eurosport and XXXXX', which could explain the low percentage as sports is dominated by males. <br> On the other hand, English speaking countries have a higher number of newspapers and hence a broader spectrum of topics. Interstingly, the United Kingdom has the highest percentage of female quotes compared to all the coutries, with 23.74 <span>&#37;</span>. South Africa seems to quote more females, in proportion to its total number of quotes, than the United States. A deeper analysis will therefore be performed especially on these 3 countries, trying to identify the reasons behind these trends.

                        <h3 style="text-align: left; vertical-align: center;">What is the evolution of the percentage of female quoted accross the years?</h3>
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">
                               The percentage of females quotes gradually increases for the UK, reaching a top in 2019 with 26.81 <span>&#37;</span>, whereas it can be considered as constant for the other two countries. Surprinsingly, an abrupt decrease appears in 2020. Could that be due to the Corona pandemic, during which mostly health care professionals were quoted? Confirming thus the gender disparity in top jobs of the medical field? (numbers?) This questions goes beyond the scope of this couontry-based analysis and could be a research question on its own. Again, the trends of South Africa and USA support our first impressions. Only in 2016 did the USA quote more female than South Africa. In 2016 took place the presidential election and the famous rivality between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton was omnipresent in the media. Indeed, it may be very interesting to focus on the unique speakers and their impact on the gender representation in the media. An average for each year does not account for the diversity of quoted females, and one unique female may be very often quoted, balancing thus the previous analysis.<br><br>
                               The evolution of female quotes for the UK is encouraging but what if it is always the same female that is quoted... 
                                On the contrary, the number of unique speakers might increase in the USA and South Africa which could be seen as counterbalancing the fact that their percentage stays constant.

                                The interactive network on the left shows the top 3 speakers for each country and gender. The size of a node is related to the proportion of quotes from this particular speaker in the country that quoted him/her and the colors stand for gender.  Here again, the inequal gender representation is manifest, since for all countries, all <span style="color: #529dc8;">male nodes</span> are bigger than <span style="color: #cc78bc;">female nodes</span>. Only Uk seems to have a "fair" repartition of nodes and a more diverse spectrum of speakers. Donald Trump, with its many designations (?) is on its own the Top-3 of males in the american press with about 1/4 of the american quotes from 2015 to 2020. Indeed he was the President of the USA from 2016 to 2020 and was omnipresent in all categories. Interestingly, the 3 most quoted females in South Africa are all involved in politics and in the age range of 50-70 years old. On the other hand, Katie Price and Meghan Markle are media personalities and much younger. This stresses out how the age of the speakers can be crucial and determinant for his/her presence in the media, and this depending on the country.

                        Above, the age distribution is shown for the 2 genders. The difference between countries is obvious and the one between gender even more. While the distribution of the male ages is only little surprining, with a slight shift towards older males for South Africa, the one of the female is very dependent on the media's country of origine. 37.8 <span>&#37;</span> of the quoted female in South Africa belong to the age interval of 60-70 years old, which is in total consistency with the top 3 female unique speakers from the previous network. Regarding the UK, one can clearly see that the distribution is skewed towards younger female. This could also be explained by the network above, with two young females appearing in the top 3 for UK, on contrary to the other 2 countries. The top 3 however cannot justify these observation in the age distribution on its own. Indeed, since the proportion of female unique speakers (see percentages above) is much lower for the USA than for South Africa, one could expect Hilary Clinton and Nanci Pelosi to have a big influence on the age distribution of females. This is however not the case here. A possible explanation for this contradiction is the fact that, despite having quoted some females only proportinally to their number of quotes, these females are very well distributed over the age intervals as one can see from the table below.
