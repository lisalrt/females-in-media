Females in media - The datastory
=========================


This website is created in order to present some results following our project for the "Applied Data Analysis" class at EPFL. 

The goal of the analysis is to examine how women are represented in the media and determine if the popular notion of underrepresentation is true or not.

The first section explains the reason behind our study as well as our primary data source.
After that, we share some of the questions we'd want to address. 

The data story is divided in two main parts:

- Who run the world ?
In this first section, we examine how females are cited globally in comparison to males, based on the country of origin of the media that quotes them.
We also analyze female representation through time in three English-speaking countries: the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Africa.
Following that, we look at the genders of the most cited speakers in each of these nations.
The top speakers' ages are displayed in an interactive network graphic.
This pushes us to further investigate if age influences who gets cited and, more specifically, whether the distribution of age differs between males and females. 
*Note*: By clicking on the legends of the different countries you may hide some in order to visiualize for each year separately.
We conclude this part by taking a look at the medias that quote the top speakers. 

- Respected vs popular media 
In the second part of the story we take look at the medias in more details by filtering the dataset based on the top 5 most respected media and the top 5 most popular (defined as the most clicked on media websites)
The purpose of this section is to investigate if highly regarded media outlets have a distinct tendency to quote women than popular outlets.
We start by looking at how each sort of media has changed throughout time.

The trend of female representation in each genre of media is next examined.
As a result, we'll look at what ladies talk about and see if there's a difference between the respectable and popular media. 
Following this analysis we picked two topics where most quotes came from females but in order to evaluate the diversity of speakers we take a look at the unique number of speakers for each gender. We also plot the number number of distinct males that are quoted for each distinct female based on the type of media and the category.
As a result of the findings, we decided to look at the average length of quotes for the two most female-oriented issues in the media.
To conclude off this section, we look at which media outlets provided quotations for both of the most "female-centric" issues. 


It is important to note that the categories were picked in a way that may bias the data (please refer to the code for additional explanations)
As an additional task we used some unspervised clustering algorithm (LDA) in order to look at the different words that come up in the quotes for both females and males.
