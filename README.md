Females in media - The datastory
=========================


This website is created in order to present some results following our project for the "Applied Data Analysis" class at EPFL. 

The project consists of analysing the representation of females in the media and whether the common idea underrepresentation is a myth or a truth.

The first part consists in explaining the motivation behind our project and our main data source.
We then present some of the questions we wish to answer.

The data story is divided in two main parts:

- Who run the world ?
In this first part we are looking into how females are quoted around the world compared to males based on the the origin of the media that quote them. 
We also compare the female representation in three English speaking countries: UK, USA and South Africa across the years.
We then dig into the most quoted speakers for each of these countries and take a look at the genders of those. An interactive network plot is presented including the age of the top speakers. This leads us to see whether age determines who will be quoted and more precisely whether the distribution of age is different amongst males and females.
*Note*: By clicking on the legends of the different countries you may hide some in order to visiualize for each year separately.
We conclude this part by taking a look at the medias that quote the top speakers. 

- Respected vs popular media 
In the second part of the story we take a closer look at the medias by filtering the dataset based on the top 5 most respected media and the top 5 most popular (defined as the most clicked on media websites)
The goal of this part is to see if highly respected medias have a different tendency in quoting females than the popular medias.
We first take a look at the evolution over the years for each type of media.
We then look at the trend of female representation within each group of media. This leads to us to take a look at what females talk about and if this differs between the respected and the popular media.
Following this analysis we picked two topics where most quotes came from females but in order to evaluate the diversity of speakers we take a look at the unique number of speakers for each gender. We also plot the number number of distinct males that are quoted for each distinct female based on the type of media and the category.
The conclusions lead us to look at the average length of the quotes for the two most female oriented topics according to the media.
To wrap up this part we take a look at which media sources generated the quotes for both the most "female driven" topics. 


It is important to note that the categories were picked in a way that may bias the data (please refer to the code for additional explanations)
As an additional task we used some unspervised clustering algorithm (LDA) in order to look at the different words that come up in the quotes for both females and males.
