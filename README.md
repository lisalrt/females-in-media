The datastory - Females in media 
=========================

This website is created in order to present some results following our project for the "Applied Data Analysis" class at EPFL. 

The goal of the analysis is to examine how females are represented in the media and determine if the popular notion of underrepresentation is true or not.

The first section explains the reason behind our study as well as our primary data source.
After that, we share some of the questions we'd want to address. 

The data story is divided in two main parts:

- Females around the world, universally represented?
In this first section, we examine how females are cited globally in comparison to males, based on the country of origin of the media that quote them.
We then focus our analysis on three English-speaking countries: the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Africa. Looking at the evolution throughout the years and the most top three of quoted speakers (for each gender) in each of these nations.
The results are displayed in an interactive network graphic, showing the age and the number of quotes of each speaker.
This pushes us to further investigate if age influences who gets cited and, more specifically, whether the distribution of age differs between males and females. 
*Note*: By clicking on the legends of the different countries you may hide some in order to visiualize for each year separately.
We conclude this part by taking a look at the medias that quote the top speakers to ensure coherence with the following section.

- Respected vs popular media 
In the second part of the story, we take look at the media in more details by filtering the dataset based on the top 5 most respected media (objective list) and the top 5 most popular (defined as the most clicked on media websites).
The purpose of this section is to investigate if highly regarded media outlets have a distinct tendency to quote females than popular outlets.
We start by looking at how each sort of media evolves throughout time.

As a result, we'll look at the categories in which females are quoted and try to identify intersting spots between the respectable and popular media. 
Following this analysis, we picked two topics where a considerable number of quotes came from females. In order to evaluate the diversity of speakers we take a look at the number of distinct speakers for each gender. We also plot the number of distinct males that are quoted for each distinct female based on the type of media and the category.

As a result of the findings, we decided to look at the average length of quotes as a measure of time-allocation for the two most female-oriented categories.
To conclude off this section, we look at which media outlets provided quotations for both of the most "female-centric" categories and their evolution over time. It is important to note that the categories were picked in a way that may bias the data (please refer to the code for additional explanations). This last point led us to perform a LDA to find explanation to the contradiction observed. Dividing the quotes into five distinct topics, this algorithm shed light on this unexpected secnario for the particular example of Reuters.
